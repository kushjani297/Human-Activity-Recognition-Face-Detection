# Human-Activity-Recognition-Face-Detection
The goal of the Human Activity Recognition project is to create a system that continuously watches and examines video from the security cameras that are ordinarily pre-installed at every store. Second, it keeps track of each customer's behavior and looks out for any questionable activity. The software instantly recognizes and alerts the supervisor of any suspicious conduct so they can evaluate the tape and take appropriate action.

The main goal of detecting human activity is to stop prospective theft. To avoid any confusion, the target is approached and asked if they need help, which increases the likelihood that the theft won't take place.

The opportunity, which is the secondary goal, is enormous! As merchants use technology more readily to better serve customer demands and increase profits. To a certain extent, this technology can prevent losses. Additionally, this technology will stop workplace fraud.

## Project Summary
In this project we are going to develop the website based on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Flutter, Python, Html, Css, Javascript.
• Here, the project gives the view of the suscpicious activity which are held in the general stores, malls, banks, jewllery shops, etc.
• So here we are going to develop a system that constantly monitors and analyzes footage of security cameras that are commonly pre-installed at all the stores.

## Project Scope
• The project scope over here is to establish how one can be standstill to the potential of moving ahead for the robbery.
• In this when AI, ML and open CV is used for the smart management of the suscpicious activity.
• Many different activities can be overwhelmed in the project so there are many scope.
• The scope of this is software is :- also used in many different department, governmental places etc.

## Objective
• The primary objective of human activity recognition is the prevention of potential theft; to prevent any type of confusion the target is approached and asked if they need help, which leads to a good chance that the theft never happens.
• The secondary objective is the opportunity, it’s huge! As the retailers become more open to embracing technology to meet consumer needs, as well as improve bottom lines. This technology can prevent losses to a certain point. Also, this technology will prevent internal frauds.

## Technology and Literature Review
• The front-end used in our project is HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and in back-end python, flutter, AI, ML, Computer Vision.
#### HTML
HTML an initialize of Hyper Text Markup Language for web pages.
It provides a means to describe the structure of text based information in document by denoting text as headings, paragraphs, lists and so on and to supplement that text with interactive forms, embedded images and other objects.
#### Javascript
JavaScript supports the development of both client and server components of web based applications.
On the client side, it can be used to write programs that are executed by a web browser within the context of the web page.
On the server side, it can be used to write web server programs that can be process information submitted by a web browser and then update the web browser display accordingly.
#### Computer Vision
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects. Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
#### Machine Learning
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
#### Flutter 
Flutter is a free and open source Google mobile UI framework that provides a fast and expressive way for developers to build native apps on both IOS and Android. Flutter builds from a single codebase, compile directly to the native arm code, Use the GPU and access the platform APIs and services.
#### Python 
Python is a general-purpose coding language—which means that, unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development. That includes back end development, software development, data science and writing system scripts among other things.
